# KSP_Flexible_Docking
A set of flexible docking ports for Kerbal Space Program.

This addon provides a set of 0.625m, 1.25m, and 2.5m flexible docking ports. These allow for a limited amount of side-to-side translation and rotation at the docking port head. This facilitates surface docking where perfectly lining up two ports can be challenging.

The amount of movement is limited and is indicated for each port in the VAB/SPH info panel
The ports can be operated in standard mode when retracted (they will behave the same as any other port) or in flexible mode when extended
	When in flexible mode they will automatically seek out nearby ports when they enter the acquisition range (which can be adjusted in the config file)
	The magnetic strength is reduced in flexible mode (also adjusted in the config file), and is indicated in the right-click context menu
	A toggle is available to completely disable the magnets; this applies to both retracted and flexible modes
All ports use textures from their stock counterparts
A Module Manager config file is included
Support for stock contracts that request a docking port is included
Connected Living Space support is included
Module Manager itself is not included but is recommended if running in Career Mode

Currently MM is required to use the correct textures
