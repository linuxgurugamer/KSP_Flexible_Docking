"LOC_FlexDock_19","When a Maxo engineer found a Clamp-O-Tron lying by the side of the road a question occured, ""What happens if both sides aren't lined up perfectly?"" The answer, the Flex-O-Clamp-O-Tron: the proven design of the standard Clamp-O-Tron mated to a tough but flexible metallic mesh that allows for limited translation and rotation to facilitate docking in the field."

"LOC_FlexDock_22","Using proprietary, tiny tools, the engineers at Maxo have created a miniature Flex-O-Clamp-O-Tron docking port. It has all of the benefits of the standard version at roughly have the size. Warning: Kerbals may become lodged in the flexible section of this docking port if they attempt to squeeze through a tight bend."

The Flex-O-Clamp-O-Tron Sr. Building on the foundation layed by their ground breaking Flex-O-Clamp-O-Tron docking port, the Maxo engineers have created an even bigger, even better flexible docking solution."
